# Charcoal
Charcoal is an cleaner class with extensive utility. Majority of my repositories rely on Charcoal; so if you plan on using one, you must acquire Charcoal!

Charcoal supports the following types: tables with a Destroy or Disconnect method, coroutines/threads, functions, Instances, and RBXConnections.

Documentation can be found within the code.
