# Charcoal
Charcoal is an cleaner class with extensive utility. It's more so a tool I use personally rather than a module made for "the public."

Charcoal supports the following types: tables with a Destroy or Disconnect method, coroutines/threads, functions, Instances, Promises, and RBXConnections.

Documentation can be found within the code.
